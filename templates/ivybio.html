  <p> My name is Ivy Gao and I am a junior majoring in neuroscience and minoring in English. I decided to take this class because I realized that computer science is important in every discipline, and I wanted to learn more about coding. A fun fact: my favorite color is orange and my favorite number is 7. </p>
